## Reflection

I am currently constructing a website dedicated to encouraging civic engagement and increasing transparency within state legislatures. The website, when finished, will contain a wide variety of data sets and interactive data visualizations relating to state governments. The faceted map presented in my flipbook is a sample of the type of visualizations that will eventually by displayed on the website. The process of producing a data viz flipbook pushed me to think differently about both data wrangling and data visualization. It required me to be more deliberate in how I wrote and ordered my code, and it revealed redundancies and other inefficiencies in my script. The process also deepened my understanding of the commands that I employed by allowing me to see the output of each individual line of code.
